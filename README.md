## 🧠 Learning Journey Highlights

> [!TIP]
> Most of my challenges and learning experiences are documented in the wiki pages. \
> While they generally document the process of building the application, quotes marked with `> [!NOTE]` are my personal cooking adventures and problem-solving recipes!

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project is organized like a well-planned kitchen:

```
MealGen/
├── graduate_frontend/    # The beautiful dining room experience
├── graduate_backend/     # Where all the cooking magic happens
```

## 🚀 Fire Up the Stove

### Ingredients You'll Need
- Node.js (v16+) - Fresh and ready to go

### Recipe for Success
The easiest way to get cooking is to clone the repository and follow the instructions in our [Setup and Installation](https://github.com/PhantomOffKanagawa/MealGen/wiki/Setup-and-Installation) wiki page.

> 🐳 **Pro Tip:** Docker makes setup as easy as instant ramen, but way more impressive! Details in the wiki.
